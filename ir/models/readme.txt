This are the results of the models trained. It is aranged based on the image id. Percentage determines confidence of model trained


1. Up arrow (99%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.

2. Down arrow (99%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.

3. Right arrow (99%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.

4. Left arrow (99%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.

5. Circle (50%)
-Cannot detect most of the time from close,far,diff angle

6. six (80%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects zero and up a fair amt of time (flickering up detected within the box of 6), rarely detects eight & circle

7. seven (85%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects x a fair amt of time when close-up, rarely detects z (detects the outline of the box with 7)

8. eight (55%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects 9 a fair amt of time(flickering 9 detected within the box of 8), rarely detects 6

9. nine (90%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Rarely detects 6 and 8

10. zero (0%)
-Cannot detect at all
-Detects 9 and v and 8 most of the time

11. v (80%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects 7 a fair amt of time (flickering 7 within box of v), rarely detects w

12. w (50%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects v most of the time (flickering v within box of w, mistaking part of w as v)

13. x(95%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.

14. y (80%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects 7 a fair amt of tiem (flickering 7 within box of y)

15. z (50%)
-Detectable from close,far,diff angle.
-Detects x most of the time (x within box of z)
